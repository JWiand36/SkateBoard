SkateBoard

The project is designed to create a board system for assigning teams to locker
rooms. The project works as a client/server system, allowing users to display
the board and have access when they are connected to the network.

For the server to work, the Main file, Event file, Pictures folder, Ice.JPG
 and the logo.JPG is required.

For the client to work, the Client file and Event file are required.

To change the picture next to the clock, replace the logo.JPG in the src folder
to your desired picture.

The file has to be spelled "logo.JPG" exactly

The same applies for the background, replace the Ice.JPG to your desired picture
in the src folder

The file has to be spelled "Ice.JPG" exactly

To add in pictures and remove pictures from the scrolling pictures. Just drag and
drop the desired pictures in the Pictures folder located in the src folder. Then
restart the program.

Exiting the server folder will save all the information and restore it upon 
startup so all the data being displayed will not be lost.

If IP.dat, Data.dat, or Events.dat are ever deleted. The program will recreate
these files when you close the client or server. Do not worry about these files
you can delete them and it wont break the program but data will be lost.
